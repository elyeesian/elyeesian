<h2>Hi.<br>I'm Anjali.</h2>
<p>
I'm a rising sophomore at the University of Maryland, College Park, and I love to code! I'm versatile with my projects, I can as easily jump from aesthetic to purely functional programming. I'm good at adapting quickly to unfamiliar environments and learning on-the-go, as you can see from this profile :)
